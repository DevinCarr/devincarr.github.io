The Github if you would like to try it out!
Inspiration I found something similar the other day on HackerNews, but it used Google's auto-complete API. Since I will be joining the Bing team soon, I decided to see if Bing has an open API that can do the same thing."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="http://devincarr.com/posts/suggest/"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2016-12-11T00:00:00-08:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2016-12-11T00:00:00-08:00"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Devin Carr"><link rel=stylesheet href=/milligram.min.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/main.css><title>Devin Carr</title></head><body><section class="post container"><div class=row><div class="column timestamp"><small>December 11, 2016</small></div></div><div class=row><article class=column><h2>Suggest</h2><hr><p>A simple commandline tool to provide auto suggestions via <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-autosuggest-api>Bing Autosuggest API</a>.</p><p>The <a href=https://github.com/DevinCarr/Suggest>Github</a> if you would like to try it out!</p><h4 id=inspiration>Inspiration</h4><p>I found something similar the other day on HackerNews, but it used Google's auto-complete API. Since I will be joining the Bing team soon, I decided to see if Bing has an open API that can do the same thing. <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services>Microsoft Cognitive Services</a> ended up having an Autosuggest API interface to. Thankfully it also provided a really simple JSON API to communicate with.</p><p>I recently needed to do some JSON parsing in C++ and found a wonderful library by <a href=https://github.com/nlohmann/json>nlohmann</a>. Thankfully it supported C++11 and was a simple drop-in header file.</p><p>This was also a great opportunity to learn how to make HTTP calls with a C++ library. Previously, I only had experience opening sockets and making TCP read/write operations. I decided to go with cURL since the I needed the ability to change the headers for the API call for the security token. Thankfully cURL has an &ldquo;Easy Interface&rdquo; and plenty of good examples.</p><h4 id=example>Example</h4><pre><code>$ s hello world
