Much of this will most likely be common knowledge to senior developers, but I wanted to share my personal views and provide a reference for some colleagues who will be entering the workforce soon.</description></item><item><title>Exoplanet Discovery via Gravitational Microlensing</title><link>http://devincarr.com/posts/exoplanet-discovery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://devincarr.com/posts/exoplanet-discovery/</guid><description>Gravitational microlensing is the influence of a stellar body on the light from a further visible body. This phenomena can be used to discover small exoplanets orbiting around a stellar body that passes in front of another visible light source. These small planets are in the range of a Super-Earth: 15-17 Earth masses.</description></item><item><title>Suggest</title><link>http://devincarr.com/posts/suggest/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2016 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://devincarr.com/posts/suggest/</guid><description>A simple commandline tool to provide auto suggestions via Bing Autosuggest API.

He cautioned me, mentioning that, &amp;ldquo;it could be used for good or for evil.&amp;rdquo; He wasn't wrong..
Echo is just your average irc connected chat bot hooked up to the ever growing Twitch.</description></item><item><title>Finishing personal projects</title><link>http://devincarr.com/posts/learning-to-complete/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://devincarr.com/posts/learning-to-complete/</guid><description>A new idea or project always seems to come to mind, sometimes during the middle of another project.

I was interested in trying to relate a large set of research papers by their concepts as an easy form of tagging/indexing.</description></item><item><title>Robot Locality within a Pipeline</title><link>http://devincarr.com/posts/robot-university-project/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://devincarr.com/posts/robot-university-project/</guid><description>Situation A small robot needs to travel down a pipeline around 18 inches in diameter. It will be powered by battery alone and cannot be communicated once within the pipe.
