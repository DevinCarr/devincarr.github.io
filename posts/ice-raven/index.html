As described by the Homeland Security: &ldquo;RAVEn will facilitate large, complex analytical projects to support ICE’s mission to enforce and investigate violations of U.S. criminal, civil, and administrative laws.&rdquo;</p><h1 id=ravens-privacy-violations>RAVEn&rsquo;s Privacy Violations</h1><p>Below I have highlighted some quotes from the Privacy Impact Assessment (<a href=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-ice055-raven-may2020.pdf>May 2020</a>) that I have found to be frightening. At this point I shouldn&rsquo;t be suprised, but yet, here I am still surprised that the U.S. government continuely abuses personal privacy in the name of &ldquo;criminal enforcement&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p>RAVEn will curate and chain together seemingly disparate raw datasets by performing advanced analytics across multiple datasets, thus enabling users to accomplish tasks currently considered too large or complex for existing systems.</p></blockquote><p>RAVEn has me thinking of PRISM all over again like it&rsquo;s 2013.</p><blockquote><p>RAVEn may contain PII relating to individuals who are non-immigrants, immigrants, U.S. citizens, or lawful permanent residents.</p></blockquote><p>Everyone is a target if you live near a border or cross one, regardless of citizen status. Everyone could be part of a larger network, everyone is a threat.</p><p>At least, that&rsquo;s how ICE views the world.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Privacy Risk:</strong> There is a risk when ingesting bulk data that changes or corrections made to PII in the underlying source systems will not be reflected in RAVEn, thus leading to inaccurate or out-of-date information being stored, shared, or used for mission purposes.
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> This risk is partially mitigated. At the time of each database connection HSI Innovation Lab will create, in consultation with source system owners, an ICA that will determine system refresh rates, auditing, logging, oversight, and data transfer rates between the systems.</p></blockquote><p>Not only is this data injested into their system, but it is kindly kept up-to date, on a very frequent basis. Many of the shared federal databases are injested daily for updates.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What opportunities are available for individuals to consent to uses, decline to provide information, or opt out of the project?</strong>
As RAVEn does not directly collect information from individuals, there is no opportunity for individuals to consent, decline, or opt out of providing information to the system. The agency or program that collected the information from individuals is best positioned to provide them with the opportunity to consent, decline to provide information, or opt out. These programs, however, may not be able to provide an individual with the opportunity to consent or decline to the use of their information, as their systems are maintained for a law enforcement purpose.</p></blockquote><p>Wonderful. But honestly, I don&rsquo;t know what I expected.</p><h1 id=ice-enforcement-and-accountability>ICE Enforcement and Accountability</h1><p>Customs and Border Protection&rsquo;s (CBP) operate within 100 miles of any land or sea border of the United States. (<a href=https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone>CBP Border Zone</a>) The ALCU mentions that this border zone covers nine of the ten largest U.S. metropolitan areas. For many, this means they are part of this CBP militarization of the border region has produced rampant abuses ranging from racial profiling to excessive force.</p><h1 id=ice-mindset-and-goals>ICE mindset and goals</h1><p>One of the big key factors here is that ICE operates under the assumption that everyone is a link to a criminal and if they reach far enough, they will find them. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong here, there are criminals that operate cross-border operations and there are illegal immigrants crossing the border. But what are these criminals doing? Moving marijauna and attempting to cross the border for better work and life oportunities?</p><p>If we could change the mindset to de-criminalization of marijauna and help direct legal avenues of trade, it would help reduce the dangerous game of escalation between the marijauna traffickers and the increasingly militarized border patrol.</p><p>Similarly with immigration, if we provide better avenues of immigration for those looking to find work across the U.S. border and refugees from foreign lands, it would reduce the need for ICE in significantly.</p><p>Just changing the mindset from &ldquo;these people are all evil&rdquo; to &ldquo;we should adopt change to support them&rdquo;, would help significantly provide better environments for all and reduce the need for a more militant border enforcement.</p><h1 id=raven-contract-bidding>RAVEn contract bidding</h1><p>Recently, a large new RAVEn contract has come up to improve the current platform to help support it forward into the future and provide for a more mobile approach to enforcement for ICE agents. Given the scale and the technological background, many large U.S. companies have attended the bidding and technical briefings on what the contract would require.</p><p>Given that I work for one of these larger companies seeking a bid and I oppose the project and how ICE conducts it, I sought out these details on the project. In doing so, I hope to provide an open letter that shows my disdian for the contract and continuing support for ICE. I clearly recognize that I have little say in how a company operates but I am at liberty to convey what I can and hope that others follow and speak up to provide a stronger voice of concern against continued bidding for this project.</p><h2 id=bidding-could-complete-soon>Bidding could complete soon</h2><p>There was a recent extension justified for BAH to provide continued support for six months for the RAVEn project and rollover into the new RAVEn contract once a bid is selected.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;This extension will ensure continued support during the competitive re-compete process and the successful completion of transition related tasks, once the new award is emplaced.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><a href=https://sam.gov/opp/4f36e0c6499d4deea71ddb6f4653d782/view>LSJ: RAVEn Extension for BAH</a></p><p>Since BAH, currently, is only extended for 6 months, the DHS is likely to close on the contract within the coming months. This means that time is likley imperative to voice a concern to your employer if you object to continue supporting ICE and what they do.</p><p>Look at the list of industry attendees to find out if some representatives from your company joined: <a href=https://sam.gov/opp/367c2add37474977801915e6182c372e/view>Industry Day Attendee List</a></p><h1 id=references>References</h1><p><a href=https://sam.gov/opp/367c2add37474977801915e6182c372e/view>RAVEn Post Industry Day Follow-Up</a></p><p><a href=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-ice055-raven-may2020.pdf>Privacy Impact Assessment for RAVEn (May 13, 2020)</a></p><p><a href=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-ice055-ravenappendixbupdate-september2021.pdf>Updated Privacy Impact Assessment for RAVEn (Sept 3, 2021)</a></p></article></div></section><footer class="post container"><div class=row><div class=column><small><a href=http://devincarr.com/>Devin Carr</a> /
