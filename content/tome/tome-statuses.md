Each of the items in the Tome are labeled with a status: {{< status idea >}} or {{< status tested >}}

# Idea

Ideas are some loosely put together ideas for a monster or augment that have not been tested yet in any capacity. This means it could be wildly unbalanced and be exploited by something I haven't thought through yet.

# Tested

These are concepts that have been through at least one session and have either been updated accordingly. There are not blantant issues with it (at least not immediately visible) and should be mostly game ready. As always, DM discretion is advised for using any type of homebrew content.
