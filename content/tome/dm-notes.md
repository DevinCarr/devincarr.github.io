DM Notes are an attempt to be a simple separation between information that is designed specifically to assist the DM and the decisions would make. In typically D&D material, there is no separation besides the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Player's Handbook. In the information that I provide, the separation is conflated since I provide information valuable for both players and DMS. For instance, the [augments]({{< ref "augments" >}} "Morda") typically are wholesale valuable for the player to understand and have additional pieces of information or features that are more relevant for the DM.
