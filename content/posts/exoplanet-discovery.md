[Gravitational microlensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing) is the influence of a stellar body on the light from a further visible body. This phenomena can be used to discover small exoplanets orbiting around a stellar body that passes in front of another visible light source. These small planets are in the range of a Super-Earth: 15-17 Earth masses.

My project consists of translating a simulation software written by the professor that I am working with. I am translating it from Fortran to C++ in the attempt to modernize the software, learn the code base to introduce parallelization, and add other optimizations.
