                <h2>Echo: A Twitch.tv Chat Bot</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    When I first thought up the idea for echo, I proposed it to a good friend of mine. He cautioned me,
                    mentioning that, "it could be used for good or for evil." He wasn't wrong..
                </p>
                <p>
                    Echo is just your average irc connected chat bot hooked up to the ever growing Twitch.tv community.
                    Echo mainly focuses on fast analysis of chat messages to process and correlate the text in the
                    messages.
                </p>
                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <p>
                    The bot will collect about 20 messages in a vector and then perform a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring_problem">Longest
                        Common Substring Analysis</a>. This will check the messages for similar text in previous
                    messages within the group of 20. This is performed in an attempt to look for spam messages that are
                    spammed throughout the chat with slight differences in an attempt to avoid spam detection bots that
                    also exist in the channels. Common bots such as <a href="https://beta.nightbot.tv/">Nightbot</a>
                    and <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/">R9K</a>
                    sit in the chat doing a similar analysis to look for more specific spam patterns: ASCII spam, ALL
                    CAPS, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Echo is unique in the fact that it has no purpose beyond discovery of spam messages. Of which, it
                    can pull out the root spam message even if a user provides an extra period or number at the end to
                    provide a unique string everytime. Echo is able to pull away the extra numbers and characters and
                    provide just the root message that is attempting (and usually succeeding) to be spammed.
                </p>
                <h4>The Dilemma</h4>
                <p>
                    This is where my friend chimed in as I was explaining the idea to him. As I had not provided a
                    moderation mechanism in the bot, it could technically be used to add in the continuous spammed
                    messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, Echo justs sits dormant on my Github. It is written in C++ and is probably my biggest Open
                    Source project that I have made with C++. Since we use it at University for most assignments, I
                    feel the most comfortable with it. If Echo interests you, <a href="https://github.com/devincarr/echo">have
                        a look</a>.
