                <h2>Robot Locality within a Pipeline</h2>
                <hr>
                <h4>Situation</h4>
                <p>
                    A small robot needs to travel down a pipeline around 18 inches in diameter. It will be powered by
                    battery alone and cannot be communicated once within the pipe. My task is to construct a method to
                    allow it to travel down the pipe in a straight line. The robot also has a neodymium magnet strong
                    enough to hold it upside down and against the fluid flow in the pipeline.
                </p>
                <h4>Issues</h4>
                <p>
                    Here is a list of issues that I have uncovered:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The robot will be magnetically attached to the pipe so any magnetic sensors will be unable to
                        be calibrated and will interfered with be the magnet.</li>
                    <li>The pipe has no light, so no light sensors would be viable unless there was an ambient light
                        also on the robot.</li>
                    <li>Any sensor that is added should be as energy efficient as possible as the robot is battery
                        powered.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>First Conclusions</h4>
                <p>
                    By using some sort of laser sensor (IR or ultrasonic) on the sides of the robot to attempt to give
                    a distance calculation between the robot and the walls would allow for a noticeable change in
                    distance. The first issue arising out of this solution would be that placing the sensors directly
                    on the sides it may reflect upwards. An easy fix to that would be to aim the sensors downwards
                    towards the curvature of the pipe to achieve maximum return on the sensors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another feasible solution would be to have odometer on each of the wheel motors to be able to
                    calculate the distance of each of the motors. Then with some distance calculations with the radius
                    of the wheels, an alteration of course could be determined to correct the robot to travel back
                    straight.
                </p>
                <h4>Final Conclusions</h4>
                <p>
                    The current robot shield that we were using for testing had a three-axis gyroscope that provided
                    digital values for angular accelerations of motion. This I was able to use to monitor for extreme
                    changes in motion to calculate which side of the pipe the robot would possibly drive up. Then by
                    applying a correction to direction can get the robot back to the bottom of the pipe.
                </p>
                <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                <p>
                    By being able to use a gyroscope already built into the robot’s shield, provided a simple solution
                    that could be accurate enough for the task as well as provide some more information than initially
                    needed. The gyroscope allowed a very simple to check for when the robot would go up a wall on a
                    turn or if it ran over some unknown object within the pipe. The robot already had the libraries
                    available which made the Arduino code very simple to setup and prototype within a test area. For
